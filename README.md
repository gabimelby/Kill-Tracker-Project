# Kill Tracker Final Project

## Project Overview

For my final project, I created an app designed to be used in basketball games to help coaches track defensive performance. Specifically, it tracks **kills**â€”which, in basketball terms, are defined as **three consecutive defensive stops**.

At Huntington Women's Basketball, our goal was to reach **10 kills per game**. Previously, we tracked this using paper, which was often messy and required manually counting defensive stops. This app simplifies the process by:

- Automatically tracking stops and kills in real time.
- Activating a "kill" once three consecutive stops are recorded.
- Displaying kills per quarter.
- Providing a game summary with total stops and kills after saving.

This app is intended for **basketball coaches at all levels** who want an efficient, organized way to monitor defensive effectiveness during games.
