# Kill Tracker Final Project

Project Overview 
  For my final project, I decided to create an app that I can use for my job next year. This app can be used during basketball games in order to track how well your defense is doing and if you need to change anything. A kill in basketball is when a team gets 3 defensive stops in a row. For Huntington Women's Basketball, our goal each game was to get 10 kills in total. 
  Before this app, we used a sheet of paper in order to track this statistic. This because very hard at times because it was messy and you had to hand count how many stops you got. This app will help because it will keep track of the overall count of stops while also activating a kill when you get 3 in a row. This will keep track of kills per each quarter and when you save the game it tallies up the total amount of kills and total amount of stops. My targeted audience for this app are coaches in every level for basketball.
